# Issues 

## Rules 
 - each heading (h3) represents an issue.
 - each issue will have a para, describing the issue. 
 - if possible, keep proof of the issue. 

### not working with negative values 
    The program generated a "segmentation fault" for the following arguments, it also did the same thing in the interactive mode:
        -3- 4 + 5 
     
     Also, no output was generated for this argument:
        "-3 - 4 + 5"
